==================
Demos and Examples
==================

The **mbircone** package includes a number of example Python demo scripts in the
`[demo] <https://github.com/cabouman/mbircone/tree/master/demo>`__
folder.

We recommend that new users first try running one of these scripts to test that the software is properly installed.
Then they can modify the scripts to create new programs that run their particular data.
Some of the scripts download public data from public websites in order to exercise the code.
